Orcus:
	* LCD functions - blitter, yuv
	* Audio
	* SD card - works and integrated with libfat, but needs improvement to be more reliable, work with more types of card, use full bus width when available, and DMA for speed
	* NAND
	* ARM940T - this will require implementing the locks in __syscalls, to prevent mallocing the same thing (and also so you can actually use mutexes etc. if newlib provides them!). probably a shared heap ptr too? Will need to translate between the two
	* F200 detection
	* F200 touchscreen

// need to pad bootloader to 0x80000 bytes so we make sure to erase the complete area. We should then reserve the final 512 bytes for config

// when loading uboot from SD card, need to check the first few bytes for 0x03E0... or whatever to find RESET vector, and load at that address

// may need to try to obligerate code for loading from nand too if we are booting from SD

// should be trivial, the code segment is easy to identify in a disassembly, just need to scan for the binary

// imagemagick render text in font to build a spritesheet?
e.g. terminus font is bdf

Executable header for bootloader -
Magic number to identify file - GP2XRAW1.0
32 character title
Load address - where in memory to copy code
8 bytes of additional information - e.g. compressed flag, is kernel
32x32 icon in rgb565
[start of code]

code should have 0xdeadbeef at end of crt0. The bootloader will copy from start of code to 0xdeadbeef to 0x0 in memory, then jump to 0x0 - this lets us load code at any arbitrary address while correctly setting up vector table, so we can load e.g. gp2xboot.img as an executable just by affixing it with the appropriate header
